This is the Coding Dojo JS developed by [Cliff Weng](https://github.com/cliffweng). This is a place for kids to learn coding through Javascripts. To view the overall road map of kids' coding curriculum, please go to the [main dojo here](https://cliffweng.github.io/coding-dojo/).

##  Getting Started

- 1. Learn [Processing](Processing.md) for basic JS syntax and structure, and some best visual coding libraries.
- 2. Learn [React](React.md) [on CodePen](https://codepen.io/walkinggeek/full/JjbGVao), so you can create your own web application.
- 3. Learn [NodeJS](NodeJS.md), so you can create your own backend and desktop application.
## Why Javascripts
Javascripts is used on all websites, so it's the "language of the web", plus, Javascript can (easily) do (through [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)) so many cool things such as:
 - [API server](https://expressjs.com/)
 - Build Websites & Desktop App [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) 
 - [AI](https://js.tensorflow.org/)
 - [Chat bot](https://discord.js.org)
 - [Trading](https://github.com/Ladinn/algotrader)
 - [Games](https://phaser.io/)
 - [IOT](https://blog.bitsrc.io/10-javascript-iot-libraries-to-use-in-your-next-projects-bef5f9136f83)
 - Manage your cloud - [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-node-js/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/nodejs/docs/reference/apis), [Azure](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-node).



## Javascript Learning Resources

- [W3Schools JS](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
- [W3Schools React](https://www.w3schools.com/react/)
- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) allows you to write code in the browser, and see the results of it as you build.
- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) Create, share, and get feedback with collaborative sandboxes for rapid web development.
